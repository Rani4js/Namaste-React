<pre>Definition in the site is: Emmet is a plug in for many popular text editors
which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow: it makes our job easier by giving us 
what we want to code in our html and css files.

    step2: Enter "!".
    You will get the basic html structure without writing entire code.</pre>
