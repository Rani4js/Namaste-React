## <p>1. What is Emmet?</p>
<pre>Definition in the site is: Emmet is a plug in for many popular text editors
which greatly improves HTML & CSS workflow: it makes our job easier by giving us 
what we want to code in our html and css files. 
Ex: step1: create a html file.
    step2: Enter "!".
    You will get the basic html structure without writing entire code.</pre>
    
## <p>2. Difference between a library and frame work?</p>

<table>
    <thead>
         <tr>
        <td>Framework</td>
        <td>Library</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tr>
        <td>Framework defines the overall architecture of the application and provides a common set of conventions for building and maintaining the code.</td>
        <td>Library is typically smaller in scope than a framework and is intended to be
used as a tool to help developers accomplish specific tasks. </td>
    </tr>
     <tr>
        <td>Frameworks tend to be more tightly coupled to the application, meaning that the framework’s code is closely interwoven with the application’s code.</td>
        <td>Libraries are typically more loosely coupled, meaning that the library’s code can be used independently of the application’s code.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Conclusion: 
<p>Code written in both libraries and frameworks was written by someone else (or another developer) to allow users to perform many standard tasks in different ways. Nor does it mean that users cannot create their own libraries.<br>
When a user uses the library programmatically, the user has full control, but when talking about the user using the framework, the framework itself has full control, not the user. Or you could say that program control is reversed when the user uses the framework instead of the library.</p>
