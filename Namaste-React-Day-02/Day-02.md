# 2. What is `Parcel/Webpack`? Why do we need it?
<p>Parcel/Webpack both are bundlers. They bundles our app, so that we can ship it to the production.
when ever we install a bundler it together installs modules, those are required to run the application most efficient way like fast, reliable, optimaized and it gives our app super powers.</p>

# 3. What is `.parcel-cache`?
<p>It is a folder created when we install parcel and it helps our app run faster. In the time of first run it stores the data of our project and when we run rerun the project it doesn't have to re-parse and re-analyze everything from scratch. It's a key reason why parcel can be so fast in development mode. And we no need to add it in our git because each time we build the project it will create.It is a temporary cache directory when building our app for development and production. </p>
